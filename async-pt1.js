/* Learning Questions
1. What is the primary difference between synchronous and asynchronous 
programming in JavaScript?
A. Synchronous javascript is what we have been doing up until now.
It runs from the top of the code to the bottom, it runs the task and result
comes out when the task is done. Asynchronous code can
run at any time in the background and while other code/functions run.

2. Why is this useful?
A. When you still want your program to run, while a certain task is being performed.

3. What problems does it solve?
A. It is very useful when tasks that take a a lot 

            Notes
I used event listeners in my final project for Module 2.
Event handlers are a form of asynchronous programming 

Event handlers are a type of callback function, or a function that gets passed on 
to another function.
